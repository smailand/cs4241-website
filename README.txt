The technical achievement that I did for this assignment was to use the HTML5 history.pushState function
to change the URL and not reload the page.

As far as layout, I kept the same layout that I've used in previous assignments because I thought
it has worked well so far. It's just meant to be a list of movies, so having them centered in a list
format seemed to make the most sense. I also considered the suggestion of in-line editing, but had already
used clicking on a movie as a way to remove it, so kept that instead. I also kept the pop up confirmation
for deleting a movie, as I wanted to make sure that people didn't accidentally delete anything.
